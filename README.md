## Title
Some Magic Craft Game

## Ideas
- Crafting stations(duh)

- Automation cost for each recipe(?)(need to learn how to automate a recipe)

- Have a list of all craftable items,no need for a wiki

## Mechanics
- Spell creation(main feature)

- ### Spell complexity: 
    - Player has max complexity the spell cant exceed.
    - Intelligence increases max capacity(stat system?)

- Spell cooldown

- Spell form(Laser/Projectile/Area/Trap)

- Spell modifier(+DMG+Complexity,Gravity,Speed,Split,Size,Rebound,Trigger)

- Mana(On character?On wand?Both?)

- Spell packing(like a bag you can craft that has a max complexity with increasing tiers)
