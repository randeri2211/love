    - [ ] Have the mechanic working
    - [ ] Have the mechanic implemented in a game sense

- [X] Make blocks only take damage from a certain threshold onward depending on hardness level

### Spell complexity: 
- [ ] Player has max complexity the spell cant exceed.
- [ ] Intelligence increases max capacity(stat system?)
- [ ] Stat system

- [ ] Spell cooldown

- [ ] Spell form(Laser/Bullet/Area/Trap)
    - [ ] Laser
    - [X] Bullet
    - [ ] Area
    - [ ] Trap

- [ ] Spell modifier(+DMG+Complexity,Gravity,Speed,Split,Size,Rebound,Trigger)

- [X] Mana(On character)
